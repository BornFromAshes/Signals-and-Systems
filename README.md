# Signals-and-Systems
In this project, we want to get a grasp on how to implement and plot signals, Fourier series and so on.
## Description
Using the matplotlib library, we'd like to plot the following continuous signals for the interval [-10,10]. (Considering drawing points with 0.01 distance) <br>

Next using the matplotlib library, plot the following discrete signal for the interval [10-10]. <br>

Next considering the following discrete and continuous signals. We'd like to find the periodicity of these signals in terms of ω. <br>

Next, we plot each of these signals for 9 different values ​​of ω using the matplotlib library. <br>

Now that we learned about drawing a diagram. In the implementation of this exercise, we want to examine some concepts of the Fourier series practically.
Assuming that we've already got acquainted with the following continuous and alternating signal and we know the related Fourier series. In this part, we want to implement a function that takes r and sums the Fourier series signals from r- to r+ and then displays the signal. It means to calculate ak and a-k every time in a loop and multiply it by the corresponding cosine signal and gradually make the main signal. Using 1000 points to create and display signals in the range of -5 to +5. <br>
